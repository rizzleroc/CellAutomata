Added a more to the rules and updated the code. 

A simple cellular automaton that simulates natural selection. Rule one - the cell takes on a random color around itself. Rule 2 - two cells can combine if they are the same color, creating a new color in the process. Rule 3 - a new cell, marked by its distinctiveness, can only combine with other new cells, irrespective of color, simulating the dynamics of early cellular combinations. Rule 4 - when a new cell successfully combines, it evolves into an amoeba, representing a significant step in cellular complexity. Additionally, a speed control feature has been implemented to adjust the pace of the evolutionary process, and a play button is now available to animate the transformation of cells into amoebas, making the simulation more interactive and visually engaging.
